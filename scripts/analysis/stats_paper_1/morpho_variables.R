#-#-#-#
# Given the strong correlations across many variables, we need to decide
# which to keep and which to omit.

# Casas-Ruiz et al. (2021) found that surface area, dynamic ratio, and 
# shoreline_complexity were related to CH4 concentration (in that order 
# of importance):

# "Littoral fraction and mean_depth were strongly correlated (rho = 0.99)
# and littoral fraction was omitted.
# Lake area and volume were also included in
# the elastic net models. Lake area was included because
# there is a size-scaling of lake morphometry, such that
# larger lakes are more fractal, less circular and more
# dish-like (figure 2). Thus, by including lake area in the
# models we can separately assess the influence of lake
# size and morphometry on the concentration of the
# different C species. Lake volume was included because
# larger lakes have a higher dilution capacity and generally
# present longer water residence times."

# Casas-Ruiz wanted to explain CH4 concentration, which
# is why the "dilution capacity" of volume was included. Not as relevant
# for our analysis. Also, their analysis included some strong collinearity:
# surface area ~ shoreline complexity: 0.74
# surface area ~ mean depth: 0.6
# shoreline complexity ~ circularity: 0.73
# shoreline complexity ~ mean depth: 0.56
# They justified this by arguing that "We chose elastic net over stepwise 
# ordinary least square regression because the penalization implemented in 
# the elastic net protects the estimates of the coefficients against 
# collinearity induced enhancement."

# here are the morpho variables used in Casas-Ruiz
# everything is correlated
dat %>%
  select(l_surface_area, l_volume, l_shoreline_development, circularity,
         l_dynamic_ratio) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  GGally::ggpairs()

# surface area is highly correlated with everything except circularity, and even
# that correlation is almost too strong to ignore (rho = -0.447). If we keep 
# surface area we need to omit everything else except circularity.
# Dynamic ratio is correlated with everything except depth and littoral
# fraction.
# Shoreline development is correlated with everything except littoral_fraction 
# (-0.445) and depth (0.34 - 0.45).
# 
# Acceptable combinations include:
# surface_area + circularity
# depth (max or mean) + shoreline development
# depth (max or mean) + dynamic ratio 
# littoral_fraction + dynamic ratio*** I like this one
# fetch (l_max length) + circularity + depth
