# discussion from Cass Ruiz et al.2021 below
# littoral fraction and mean_depth were strongly correlated (rho = 0.99)
# and littoral fraction was omitted.
#Lake area and volume were also included in
#the elastic net models. Lake area was included because
#there is a size-scaling of lake morphometry, such that
#larger lakes are more fractal, less circular and more
#dish-like (figure 2). Thus, by including lake area in the
#models we can separately assess the influence of lake
#size and morphometry on the concentration of the
#different C species. Lake volume was included because
#larger lakes have a higher dilution capacity and generally
#present longer water residence times.

# here are the morpho variables used in Cass Ruiz
# surface_area and volume are correlated at rho=0.99
